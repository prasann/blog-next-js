The 3PL will likely have a view on stocks that are managed in their warehouse. They need a source of truth for their stock data across the warehouses.</li>\n<li>There is no dimension of warehouse in the current system. The stock entry is defaulted to their only warehouse. The current system also lacked the details for stock being non-sellable (like In Transit, Damaged, Missing etc).</li>\n<li>Current legacy system was hard to change. Hence it was decided to move the stock domain into a new system. It will be done gradually, meaning for a considerable time we will need both the systems to co-exist.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"designdecision\">Design Decision</h2>\n<p>Focussing on the above-mentioned problems, we decided to go with a new Stock service that integrates with the 3PL company and becomes the source of truth for the stock data.</p>\n<p>But then the old system is hard to decommission in one go, so the decision was made to keep the Monolith along with the new service. \nThe current workflows involving their current warehouse will be done via the old Monolith and the newer warehouses will start using the new Stock service.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"New stock service will co-exist with the monolith‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"responsibilitiesofmonolith\">Responsibilities of Monolith</h2>\n<p>The monolith system with the Aurora database had the stock information for their current warehouse and whenever a buyer buys items from the current warehouse, it was handled by this system and stock count reflected in its database.</p>\n<h2 id=\"responsibilitiesofnewstockservice\">Responsibilities of New stock service</h2>\n<p>The new stock service will have couchbase as its database and become the source of truth with respect to all the stock data. The new service will integrate with the new third party logistics (3PL) to manage the stocks in the new warehouse. \nThe new service will have a more granular level of stock information of non-sellable stocks. Any business intelligence reporting tool related to stock will be connected only with the new stock service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"continuoussynchronizationofdataacrossdatabases\">Continuous synchronization of data across databases</h2>\n<p>This architecture opens up with a problem of continuous synchronization of data between the Aurora database and the Couchbase instance. \nSince the new service will be the source of truth, and the old one will be decommissioned eventually, it was decided that the synchronization will be one way between Aurora to Couchbase only. \nThis means, the old system will not have stock details for the new warehouse(s).</p>\n<p>In order to achieve the data synchronization we opted in for <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture\">Change data capture pattern</a></em>. We went with <a href=\"https://debezium.io/\">Debezium</a>, to implement the change data capture.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reasonstogowithdebezium\">Reasons to go with Debezium</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>It‚Äôs an open source platform.</li>\n<li>It can be easily used alongside Kafka. We had kafka already in our ecosystem. So the operational overhead was minimum</li>\n<li>There are a wide variety of connectors present for Debezium to connect to source and sink.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We deployed Debezium as <a href=\"https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/architecture.html\">Kafka connectors</a>. They generate Kafka events whenever the configured table(s) has any changes. \nThe events were in <a href=\"https://avro.apache.org/\">Apache Avro</a> format and were published to an underlying Kafka instance. \nWe will then have a sink connector which listens to configured events and then posts it back to Couchbase.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./../_images/cdc-post/img-stock-service.png\" alt=\"Stock service architecture\" title=\"Stock service architecture\" /></p>\n<p>Few more things that needed additional care for this change data capture setup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"transformingnormalizedtableintoadenormalizedstructure\">Transforming normalized table into a denormalized structure</h2>\n<p>One of the challenges that we need to address while setting up the CDC is the compatibility of source and destination data structures. \nAurora being a RDBMS database, the schemas are designed with normalization. \nIn couchbase we had these records in a flat structure. So, multiple records in MySQL will be mapped to a single record in the couchbase.</p>\n<p>Let me take an example here. Consider the following tables with the columns.</p>\n<p>For any change in the above tables, a CDC event will be created with a content of old data and the modified data. \nIn our couchbase, we had them as documents so we will need to perform a join operation with other tables to create a document.</p>\n<p>This join operation was the tricky part to solve. Initially our approach was to use a RDBMS data store, to store the denormalized structure. \nSo every CDC event will update this table and from there another CDC event will help us to update the couchbase instance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./../_images/cdc-post/img-initial-setup.png\" alt=\"Initial setup with interim database\" title=\"Initial setup with interim database\" /></p>\n<p>This approach meant an overhead of maintaining an additional database, additional CDC setup.</p>\n<p>So, eventually we moved to Kafka streams to solve this problem of joins. \nWe did explore <a href=\"https://ksqldb.io/\">KsqlDB</a> that‚Äôs built on Kafka streams but then felt Kafka streams api was sufficient for us to get going. \nAnother alternative we started exploring and eventually dropped due to the learning curve was <a href=\"https://flink.apache.org/\">Apache Flink</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scaleandmonitoringaspects\">Scale and monitoring aspects</h2>\n<p>We had ~1.5million records of product data, ~5.3 million records of product variants in the database that need to be synced. \nThere were a few more tables that we needed to consume data from. On an average we were having ~60-75 CDC events per second related to our tables coming into our queue.</p>\n<p>Monitoring CDC wasn‚Äôt very different from monitoring our kafka queues. For Kafka monitoring, we had <a href=\"https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12460\">this dashboard</a> and extended it. \nAdditionally, to this we had a dashboard to monitor the health of the connectors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"firsttimeloadmigration\">First time load/migration</h2>\n<p>In our case we used the exact CDC setup for the initial load as well. \nDebezium sink connectors offered throttling ability, so the spiked load on our couchbase instances were avoided. \nThough it took time to clear all the messages in our kafka queue, it avoided an additional solution for the first time load.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whentogoforcdc\">When to go for CDC?</h2>\n<p>CDC is a useful technique when doing a microservices migration using a strangler fig pattern. \nIn cases where you need to maintain multiple databases with different structures. \nIn my opinion, Debezium seems to be the best open source solution available right now.</p>",

One of the challenges for me is that I was always reactive. Usually the needs are EC2, ECS, S3, Cloudfront, Cloudwatch and RDS and that's it. I haven't tried lots of their services, and I wasn't even aware of the optimisations that can be done on both cost as well as in the architecture front.</p>\n<p>Decided to pick up this certification AWS SAA to proactively design and build secured, resilient and cost optimised architectures upfront and not to wait for the issues to pop up and then optimise. This is my first certification and certainly re-lived my college exam days while preparing for this exam.</p>\n<h2 id=\"preparation\">Preparation</h2>\n<p>Started this around ~3 months back, but was very much overwhelmed with the amount of materials (courses/ notes) that's on the internet. Eventually settled on the following things,</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/\">Udemy course</a> by <strong><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/user/stephane-maarek/\">Stephane Maarek</a> üé•</strong>&nbsp;This is the longest course (~27hours) I have ever signed up for. This is an excellent start if you are looking to get this certification. This gives an intro and decent depth on all (almost) the AWS services. If you follow the hands-on approach along with Stephen, you will be equally confident in managing these services.</li>\n<li>This <a href=\"https://github.com/keenanromain/AWS-SAA-C02-Study-Guide\">Github notes</a> üìù Though the videos are exhaustive, it's impossible to remember everything that's in there. That's where these Github notes helped me. Whenever I had some 15 mins, i goto a section in here and read through that.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.ankiweb.net/\">Anki Cards:</a> üìá&nbsp;Using flashcards to revise and memorise is my habit for a long time. Thanks to this <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/AWS-SAA-Certification-1c3d99ed38ab494ea8ea467cd27ca725\">reddit user</a>, there is an excellent summary of all the services. You can import them to the anki app and you are good to go. 20 cards a day and your certification isn't far away üòÅ</li>\n<li>Took the <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c02/\">practice exams in Udemy</a>. ‚úçüèº&nbsp;This is an eye opener for me. I can understand and relate to most of the questions (thanks to the course and notes) but this is where we need to apply the knowledge we learnt and it wasn't easy. I decided to take all the tests in the course as open book types. After a couple of tests, I realised an open book takes a lot of time and decided to make some guesses and mark those guess questions for later review.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"onthedayexperience\">On the day experience</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I took the exam through Pearson Vue online. Make sure to keep the work desk (wherever the laptop/computer is placed) clean. They do check that üòÖ</li>\n<li>You can check in 30 mins before the scheduled time, and likely the exam will also start early.</li>\n<li>One day before the exam, go through the system check and keep things ready.</li>\n<li>You will have your video and mic turned on throughout the exam, you can't mute or turn off the video.</li>\n<li>My guess on the evaluation part. There are lots of questions where they offer partial marks. So the score isn't binary (right or wrong). so don't give up halfway, if you have done the preparations well you are likely to pass the exam.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"sometipsifiwanttoredothis\">Some tips if i want to re-do this</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Book the exam dates upfront.</strong> There isn't enough motivation to run through the gazillion notes, so have a milestone. It isn't a big problem, since you can amend the dates twice.</li>\n<li><strong>Pair with a like minded person.</strong> Again not to drop the ball on the certification and have someone to talk to.</li>\n<li>You can't master concepts along with the details in one go. accept that. so <strong>don't spend too much time on one thing</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Spend more time on model exams/tests</strong>. From a time perspective, split it 50-50 roughly. Spend 50% time to go over the video courses, understanding the concepts and the remaining 50 to go over the model tests.</li>\n<li>For non native english speakers, there is a provision to <strong>get 30 mins extra time for the exam.</strong> <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/certification/policies/before-testing/\"></a> <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/certification/policies/before-testing/\">(ESL+30)</a>.

Saga pattern breaks a single business transaction into a sequence of local transactions that updates each service and publishes a message or event to trigger the next local transaction step. If any of these local transaction fails, saga will execute the subsequent flows to  rollback and cleanup the transaction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydoweneedthis\">Why do we need this</h2>\n<p>In a micro-services architecture, it's hard to trace where the transaction has failed and what needs to be rolled back etc. Saga brings in a structure to deal with this problem and also allows the micro-services to act within the specified boundaries.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implementingsaga\">Implementing Saga</h2>\n<p>Saga is implemented by adding a <code>transactionId</code> to all the local transactions. A <code>transactionId</code> represent a single business transactions, so with that as an identifier it is possible to trace all the corresponding service interactions.</p>\n<p>This managing of local transactions can be done in 2 styles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Orchestration style</li>\n<li>Choreography style</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"orchestrationstylesagas\">Orchestration Style Sagas</h2>\n<p>Orchestration pattern mimics an Orchestra, where each person (system in this case) waits for the conductor (another system) to give instructions on what needs to be done.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/saga-patterns/orchestration.png\" alt=\"Orchestration style saga {800xx972}\" title=\"Orchestration style saga\" /></p>\n<p>I don't prefer this design usually for the following reasons,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tight coupling between the conductor and the other systems in the ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Conductor is a single point of failure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"choreographystylesagas\">Choreography Style Sagas</h2>\n<p>Choreography pattern mimics a dance performance where each dancer knows their role and can perform it independently. Hence, there is no need of centralised conductor role.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/saga-patterns/choreography.png\" alt=\"Choreography style saga {800xx972}\" title=\"Choreography style saga\" /></p>\n<p>Some benefits of this pattern are,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Faster development. Teams can build independently, with defined contracts.</li>\n<li>Loose coupling, easier to change systems.</li>\n<li>Better fault tolerance. There is no single point of failure here</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"asamplescenario\">A Sample Scenario</h2>\n<p>Let us walk through a sample use case and see how we can go about solving it using choreography style sagas.</p>\n<p>Since we are talking about music and dance, let me take a use case of booking a movie ticket.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A customer can purchase a movie ticket by paying online.</li>\n<li>Once the payment is successful, the movie ticket is confirmed to that customer.</li>\n<li>If there is a payment failure, no ticket will be issued, and the order stands cancelled.</li>\n<li>If the show is cancelled, the customer will be fully refunded.</li>\n<li>If the customer choses to cancel a ticket, then they will be refunded a partial amount only.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"identifyingeventsandcommands\">Identifying Events and Commands</h2>\n<p>Now, to implement them independently by various services, we need to identify the boundaries of various services and also their resposibilities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eventstorming.com/\">Event storming</a> is one activity that the team can do to identify these events aka boundaries of responsibilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Results of the event storming looks like this:</strong></p>\n<p>I will be using the following notion to illustrate various commands and events involved in the above use-case.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/saga-patterns/legend.png\" alt=\"legend {800xx272}\" title=\"legend\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/saga-patterns/booking-flow.png\" alt=\"booking-flow {800xx850}\" title=\"booking-flow\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/saga-patterns/cancel-flow.png\" alt=\"cancel-flow {800xx850}\" title=\"cancel-flow\" /></p>\n<p>Once these events and commands are identified, teams independently can go ahead and start implementing them. Rollbacks are just another events mapped to a different command.</p>\n<p>This gives a power to the team to act independently and reduces the bottleneck on a single service.</p>",

I have been part of few teams that build and deploy micro-services in a large scale.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One pertinent question that often asked is \"<strong><em>Did we slice it right?</em></strong>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"whatisslicingaservicemean\">What is slicing a service mean</h2>\n<p>Slicing a micro-service refers to defining the boundaries of the micro-service.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What should the service be responsible for</li>\n<li>What kind of data should it hold</li>\n<li>When it should delegate it's responsibility to another micro-service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below are some of my experiences, that i have seen working.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whentodoit\">When to do it</h2>\n<p>One of the common behaviour we did in the teams I worked so far, is to let micro-services <strong>evolve</strong> organically. We add feature/capabilities to the existing service and later trim down the service by spawning a new one.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fz8fj6jt4y0z5rlp1irs.png\" alt=\"organic slicing of micro-service\" /></p>\n<p>Some of the benefits,</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No need of upfront discussion</strong>. Most likely we will have lesser information about the feature, then likely that our design might reflect the incompetencies.</li>\n<li><strong>Spawning a new service will have it's own cost</strong>. How much ever you automate, it still adds up the infrastructure cost, maintenance cost. If we are wrong about the slicing then we had to spend some more time and effort to unify it with some other service.</li>\n<li>Once we have built a feature, most of the <strong>people in the team will understand the use-case and will appreciate the need of a separate service</strong>. It doesn't become a single person's decision or a group of architect's decision. But a decision that comes from ground up. There  is a better chance for the service the retain it's shape when it grew this way.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This approach does require a good discipline in having a constant check on the growth of a service. A highly coupled service is very hard to break down later. And if we are too late to cut down a service, it might become an expensive operation too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtodoit\">How to do it</h2>\n<p>Here are some of the themes i have come across. I will try to explain my thoughts using a bare minimum add-to-cart like domain problem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"entitybasedslicing\">Entity based slicing</h3>\n<p>Very common and obvious start for a new service.</p>\n<p>Example: <code>UserService</code> dealing with the CRUD of a <code>User</code> entity in the system.</p>\n<p>It's easy to conclude <strong>entities (domain models)</strong> as boundaries, since it's intuitive for people to see the separation. But whether it's right? is highly questionable and depends a lot, on the use case.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It's simple, easy and often end up in chaos</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the significant problems, i have seen is that these services will be very much in demand by other service. They entire network becomes very chatty. One can assume the <code>User</code> entity will be needed at each and every step of the application and will have lots of interaction. Worst, is when the services decided to retain their copy of the data to enhance the performance of the application.</p>\n<p>Orchestrator will become a monolith. Since there will be lots of entity services to do mundane operation, orchestrator will become the one service to hold the business logic.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/si5fohmhiv4aqoa1h7xi.png\" alt=\"entity based slicing {336xx271}\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"journeybasedslicing\">Journey based slicing</h3>\n<p>Slicing services based on <strong>user journeys and behaviour</strong>. This is quite popular, especially among the product people. Mostly, the product evolution happens on a feature/journey based. So whenever a new journey is identified it's time to build a new service.</p>\n<p>Ex: <code>RatingService</code> a service that allows you to rate an entity. It can be products, people or article etc. Behaviours can include to make sure you don't rate same article twice, compute average ratings etc.</p>\n<p>One of the advantage of this technique is that usually the teams i have worked in the past, they own the journey and hence it's clear for them what needs to be the part of this service</p>\n<p>Huge drawback I have seen with this approach, is that it forces the data being duplicated across services. In order to maintain the true flavour of Microservice, we will end up having independent databases and eventually having duplicate data</p>\n<h3 id=\"bestofbothworlds\">Best of both worlds</h3>\n<p>It makes a lot of sense to combine the above 2 approaches. Identify the core entities (domain models) of the system, and have them as either independent or logically grouped service. Apply journey based slicing on top of this entity services. So, the teams will own the journey service and the entity services can be maintained by group of teams.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/degdriqsoudx0xhr4pgt.png\" alt=\"best of both worlds {336xx271}\" /></p>\n<p>Some of the conventions that i have seen/worked while slicing Micro-services</p>\n<p><strong>Entity services should be thin and lenient.</strong></p>\n<p>Entity services should be merely act as APIs to the database operations. Do not try bringing in business logic here.</p>\n<p>For example, making the email-address non updatable in the entity service level. It makes sense to not to allow the end-user to allow update the email addresses, but often that might be a need from a back office personnel (admin user). So restricting such operation in the entity level might not be worth it. <strong>Journeys should take care of validations.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It's hard to predict the future requirements so keep EntityServices simple and open for extension.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Avoid journey service calling other journey services</strong></p>\n<p>Journey services, should be independent of others. Store data that are necessary for the journey and use entity services to collaborate with common data.</p>\n<p><strong>Build composite entities wherever needed</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Now, to answer the immediate question that will raise due to the above constraint. How to manage the duplicate business logic.  To be honest, <strong>DRY principle is overrated in my opinion.</strong> But in case if you are looking for such thing, then try adding another layer of composite entities.</li>\n<li>These composite entities, will encapsulate multiple entities and some business logic around this. One classic example from the app we built is a tax computation service. It involves the product, and the location of the buyer to calculate the tax.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All these things are from my past experience, I'm sure I'm going to learn more and course correct myself in this journey. But one thing that i feel will always help in evolving micro-services is to constantly question the slicing decision to get it at a right state. And also a good knowledge on the <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html\">Domain driven design</a> helps a lot to take these decisions.</p>",

Scaling Applications</strong></h2>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/scaling-microfrontends/Twitter_post_-_1.png\" alt=\"Scaling applications\" title=\"Scaling applications\" /></p>\n<p>In general, scaling applications implies scaling backend applications to serve an increasing number of users.

However,</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Scaling frontend apps is also about&nbsp;scaling development teams, both by size (growing a size of a single team) or count (multiple teams)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, applications are getting more frontend heavy because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>backends are getting easier to deploy and get off the ground</li>\n<li>end-user compute is getting cheaper and more powerful everyday</li>\n<li>more functionality is being pushed to end-user interfaces and devices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a result of this, product teams need to figure out an efficient way to build and deliver frontend applications with multiple development teams working at scale.

Monoliths, Microservices and Micro-frontends</strong></h2>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Monoliths are not a bad design choice</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's always best to start any application as a monolith. Upfront slicing of module boundaries is very hard and tends to go wrong. As the application grows, it's better to identify module boundaries and split them up.</p>\n<p><strong>Microservices</strong></p>\n<p>From monoliths, the best choice to evolve the backend services as microservices. We can then guarantee:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strong module boundaries</li>\n<li>Independent deployment</li>\n<li>Polyglot development and tech diversity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, most of the microservices I have seen are as follows</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/scaling-microfrontends/Twitter_post_-_2.png\" alt=\"Microservices\" title=\"Microservices\" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Independent deployments ! == Independent releases</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Teams are able to develop and deploy backends independently. However, they need to wait for the frontend to be developed and deployed.</p>\n<p><strong>Enter Micro-frontends</strong></p>\n<p>Micro-frontends are nothing but taking the concept of micro-services to the frontend. Slice the frontend of the application to respect the module boundaries of the backend, and create an end-end independent release path.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/scaling-microfrontends/Twitter_post_-_3.png\" alt=\"Microfrontends\" title=\"Microfrontends\" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All of Microservices' promises + Independent releases</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"gainswithmicrofrontends\"><strong>Gains with Micro-frontends</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Independent teams</li>\n<li>Independent releases</li>\n<li>Simple, decoupled codebases</li>\n<li>Incremental upgrades</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"problemsthatneedsolving\"><strong>Problems that need solving</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>T<strong><em>o 'share, or not to share'?</em></strong>&nbsp;- Code reusability is one of the most overrated principles in software development. The problems of reusability are often ignored or not shared. In going the micro-frontend way, this needs to be discussed among the teams. Out of the gate, a duplicate first strategy works since it allows teams to execute faster initially.</li>\n<li><strong>Application loading performance</strong>&nbsp;- Micro-frontends can cause an impact on the loading performance of the application. There are ways to mitigate it, but the effort it takes has to be taken into consideration.</li>\n<li><strong>Design consistency across the application -</strong> Having a larger number of people working on an application will lead to inconsistencies. Again, there are ways to mitigate this, however, the effort involved in mitigation needs to be considered.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"3keydecisionswhiledoingmicrofrontends\"><strong>3. Key decisions while doing Micro-frontends</strong></h2>\n<p>Let's go over some of the major decisions that we need to take during the early stages of a micro-frontend application. I will try to cover the solution(s) that we took while building an application with distributed teams across 3 regions for 2 years. The decisions can vary based on the project context but nevertheless these problems need to be solved.</p>\n<p>In order to explain the challenges and decision, I will take up the following use-case:</p>\n<p><strong>Building an application to allow user to configure and buy a laptop. Similar to that of Apple's.</strong></p>\n<p>A user can <strong><em>configure</em></strong> a laptop with various components, accessories, protection plans, etc. The user should be able to <strong><em>search</em></strong> for accessories, or maybe built-in models, and then finally should be able to <strong><em>order</em></strong> the product and get it fulfilled.</p>\n<p>Apart from the 3 services - configure, search, and order, I will have another service called \"Frame\" merely to hold the application together.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Frame</strong>: A business logic agnostic orchestrator service that knows how to download the rest of the services' frontend</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A) Composing multiple front-ends into a single application</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>End users don't care about the tech used. Their experience should not be affected due to tech.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Composing multiple frontends into a single application is one of the first problems that needs solving when choosing micro-frontends.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/scaling-microfrontends/Twitter_post_-_4.png\" alt=\"Composing frontends into single app\" title=\"Composing frontends into single app\" />\n<strong>Composing front-ends</strong></p>\n<p>We can achieve this composition in 2 ways, let's go over the pros and cons of these approaches.</p>\n<h2 id=\"buildtimecompositionvsruntimecomposition\"><strong>Build-time Composition vs Run-time Composition</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Build-time composition</strong> is where multiple frontend applications are built as a single big application and served. This can be accomplished using&nbsp;<strong>npm</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>yarn</strong>&nbsp;packages.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/scaling-microfrontends/build-time-composition.png\" alt=\"Build time composition {800xx235}\" title=\"Build time composition\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Good dependency management, resulting in smaller bundles</li>\n<li>Independent cross team development</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A monolith built by different teams</li>\n<li>Non atomic deployments</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A Run-time composition</strong> is where the frontends get integrated into the browser directly when the user requests a page. This may be done on the \"Server-Side\" or in the \"Client-Side\"</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/scaling-microfrontends/run_time_frontend_composition_f5076854e1.png\" alt=\"Run-time composition {800xx373}\" title=\"Run-time composition\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Independent teams with independent deployments</li>\n<li>Atomic deployments, so no versioning issues</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Too many API requests from Client(?), with increased bundle size</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Toolkit options for Runtime composition</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Server side:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>SSI (Server Side Includes)</li>\n<li>Tailor (from Zalando)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Client Side:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>JSPM</li>\n<li>SystemJS</li>\n<li>FrintJS</li>\n<li>Single-Spa</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>We chose Run-time composition for the project we worked on. Since our app was rendered on the client-side, it was simpler for us to achieve this.</em></strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"bcommunicationbetweenthefrontends\"><strong>B) Communication between the frontends</strong></h2>\n<p>Multiple frontends need to share data with each other. Though this needs to be minimal, it's unavoidable. A couple of options to achieve this is by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>State management tools</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A global store in the application and all frontends using the same library to access the store.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/scaling-microfrontends/state_management_tools_604f976fa9.png\" alt=\"State management tools {800xx153}\" title=\"State management tools\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Window events</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another approach could be to utilize the window (DOMs) eventing capability. Below is a sample event.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/scaling-microfrontends/window_events_46783b22ad.png\" alt=\"Window events {800xx250}\" title=\"Window events\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>We used to communicate through common redux store and redux events as all the apps in our micro-frontends were using Redux.</em></strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"cdesignconsistency\"><strong>C) Design Consistency</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the hardest problem to solve for is design consistency.</p>\n<p>In our team, we addressed this challenge by forming guilds. Consider that there are three teams, and each team has a designer assigned to it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/scaling-microfrontends/Twitter_post_-_5.png\" alt=\"Actual team structure\" title=\"Actual team structure\" /></p>\n<p>We formed a guild comprising of all designers and some interested developers. They encompass a virtual team. They take all the design decisions and make sure their respective teams are abiding by the central design tenets.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/scaling-microfrontends/Twitter_post_-_6.png\" alt=\"Guild1\" title=\"Guild1\" /></p>\n<p>Initially, the guild created a style guide for the application. Mainly CSS and the application teams copy-pasted it from the style guide to build components.</p>\n<p>As we developed more features, we started pulling out Higher-order JS components and made them sharable. This is more of an evolution and works well once you have a stable design system in place.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/scaling-microfrontends/Twitter_post_-_7.png\" alt=\"Styleguide {800xx400}\" title=\"Styleguide\" /></p>\n<p>And also, since the teams were using the same frontend framework (React) it was easier for us to build this component library.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dtestingstrategy\"><strong>D) Testing Strategy</strong></h2>\n<p>Deciding on \"How to test\" is important. Since it's a relatively newer paradigm and there are lots of moving parts in the application.</p>\n<p>Primarily we will be discussing the \"Integration tests\" and \"Functional tests\" from the testing strategy, as there won't be much difference in the way the \"Unit tests\" are done.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Integration tests</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having a lightweight \"Consumer Driven Contracts\" (CDC) helped us a lot.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/scaling-microfrontends/testing_strategy_1776956c37.png\" alt=\"Integration tests\" title=\"Integration tests\" /></p>\n<p>A CDC is where the consumer services' give some tests to the provider service. A provider has to run all of its consumer services before publishing an artifact for deployment.</p>\n<p>This doesn't need to be very complex and can be done quickly using some lightweight options without using any big frameworks. But then, it's all case by case.</p>\n<p>In our scenario, Frame was the consumer of all the services and it shared a simple JSON contract and a small JS test with all of its providers. This ensured that the frame wasn't broken when a service deployed automatically.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/scaling-microfrontends/sample_of_frames_contract_025a143c30.png\" alt=\"Frame test {800xx333}\" title=\"Frame test\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Functional tests</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is one of my least favorite testing methods, however, like everything else in tech, it does have some staunch supporters and followers. In our case, we only had a few critical and successful user journeys automated using Selenium for functional testing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/posts/images/scaling-microfrontends/functional_tests_6cdcf7c24a.png\" alt=\"Functional tests {800xx400}\" title=\"Functional tests\" /></p>\n<p>These journeys cut across multiple services and hence are harder to develop and maintain. Some of the FAQs I usually get on these tests are</p>\n<h2 id=\"faqs\"><strong>FAQs</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Who owns functional tests?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ans. The product team and business analysts. They define the scenarios for automation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Who writes functional tests?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ans. Guild containing QAs from all teams and a few developers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Who fixes functional tests?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ans. Team which breaks it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenshouldyouoptformicrofrontends\"><strong>When should you opt for Micro-frontends?</strong></h2>\n<p>Micro frontends are not for everyone. It adds significant overhead with development and maintenance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A. Distributed self-contained teams, with a need for parallelization</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your development teams aren't co-located, and there is a decent amount of parallelization that needs to be done, this could be a reason to implement micro-frontends.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>B. Collaborate with different frameworks in the frontend</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Imagine you are inheriting a legacy application but want to build a new feature with modern design elements, then micro-frontends gives you a good head start.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>C. Teams that have experience building Microservices application, and are willing to take it to the next step</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of the points mentioned here are forward-thinking practices. Micro-frontends needs a good solid understanding of the domain and good discipline to contain things within one's boundary.</p>\n<p>Finally, it's worth remembering that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It's not a sprint. It's a marathon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Micro-frontends adds significant overhead to the overall application. This isn't desired for smaller applications or for the application that will be built and managed by a single team. The above mentioned challenges are worth solving, only if you are up for a longer run with multiple teams.</p>",

Like a JIRA, Confluence plugins.</p>\n<p>Best way to start with ACE is to bootstrap from <code>atlas-connect</code> Y<a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-connect-express/src/master/\">ou can follow the documentation here to get a sample app up and running in few minutes.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"aceandhandlebars\">ACE and handlebars</h2>\n<p>ACE is a wrapper on top of the <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\">expressjs</a> and hence the application is pretty much an express application. The bootstrapped application will have both the frontend and the backend part.  For the frontend, ACE by default uses <a href=\"https://handlebarsjs.com/\">handlebars</a> as templating option.</p>\n<p>When you make a API call, the server converts the handlebar templates into HTML and returns.</p>\n<h2 id=\"replacehandlebarsviewswithaspa\">Replace Handlebars views with a SPA</h2>\n<p>As you can see, the above mechanism isn't tailored to use any single page application. Luckily, ACE doesn't change lots of things from express and hence we can use the same technique to achieve the goal.</p>\n<p><strong><em>In this example I'm choosing <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a>, however the technique is fairly the same for any SPA framework.</em></strong> Since the idea is fairly simple. Using the framework build the app and deliver it to the browser on the init api call. From then on, the app will be controlled by the browser.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upandrunningwithreact\">Up and running with React.</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Add a route to serve static files.</strong></p>\n<p>To the already bootstrapped ACE project, i added a folder called client, and inside that I used <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app\">CRA</a> to bootstrap my React project. This will be my SPA. Make sure to keep  the built artifact within this folder. In my case it was <code>{ProjectRoot}/client/build/*</code></p>\n<p>Now in the express application's index.js need to modify the route to serve this page. In my case, i used <a href=\"https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/modules/page/\">generalPages module</a> of ACE. In <code>atlassian-connect.json</code> I have mentioned <code>url</code> to be <code>/init</code></p>\n<p>Here is the modified <code>/init</code> to serve the react app.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">app.get('/init', addon.authenticate(), (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '/../client/build/', 'index.html'));\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>you can import the path like this <code>import path from 'path';</code></p>\n<p>2<strong>. Configure static directories for express server.</strong></p>\n<p>Next is to set the path variable for the express. You need to define the static directory for the express server to fetch the files from.</p>\n<p>in <code>app.js</code> you can configure this.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">const app = express();\nconst addon = ace(app);\n\n/* more config */\n\nconst staticDir = path.join(__dirname, 'public');\n//*** This line is important **********//\n\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'client', 'build')));\n\n//*** This line is important **********//\napp.use(express.static(staticDir));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, we have configured express to look into 2 different directories for static files.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Include atlassian JS API as part of the SPA</strong></p>\n<p>Lastly, we need to make a change in the client app. Jira/Confluence when they load their plugin, they expect the plugin to have <code>all.js</code> . This is the client side logic of ace. So, we need to include this as part of our React's <code>index.html</code> without this, <strong><em>the loader in Jira will never disappear</em></strong></p>\n<p>In <code>client/public/index.html</code> add the script tag just below the body.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">&lt;script\n    src=\"https://connect-cdn.atl-paas.net/all.js\"\n    type=\"text/javascript\"\n    data-options=\"sizeToParent:true;resize:false\"\n&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can read about more <code>data-options</code> <a href=\"https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/about-the-javascript-api/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>That's it, you will now see the React application in the connect app.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</strong> In development mode, there isn't any hot reload in this case. If you make any changes to the react app, need to build the app manually. Ofcourse, you can modify the <code>package.json</code> to automate this, but <code>webpack-dev-server</code> isn't much helpful.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"authenticationwithintheconnectapp\">Authentication within the connect app</h2>\n<p>If you are planning to bundle few APIs along with the react app, then one of the harder thing to crack is authentication. This isn't documented very clearly anywhere.</p>\n<p>ACE uses a JWT to authenticate api's and unfortunately the token isn't accessible for React application since it is running inside a iframe by default. If you are using the default Handlebars, ACE provides  helper methods to access the JWT.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workaround\">Workaround</h3>\n<p>The first call from JIRA/Confluence call will carry the JWT. In the above code snippet <code>addon.authenticate()</code> will validate the JWT executes the callback. In this place, we can create a JWT and set it as cookie header. Post that, in all the API calls made from React app, we can validate the JWT against our secret, and it will sort out the issue of authentication.</p>\n<p>Here is a sample code for a Hello world with ACE and React. <a href=\"https://github.com/prasann/ace-with-react\">Github Source.</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><em><strong>Note: All my examples are in typescript and there are million other ways to achieve similar result, this is just my way of doing things.</strong></em></p>\n<p>If you are looking to start a new application in express, go over to the express site, use <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html\">express-generator</a> to create an application.</p>\n<h2 id=\"errorhandling\">Error handling</h2>\n<p>By default, any errors that are thrown within your application, will be sent as a 500 response code, along with the error stack trace in the body. This was inconvenient for me since,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don't want the end-user to know the system stack trace.</li>\n<li>I want to use exceptions for errors like <code>BadRequest</code> <code>AuthExceptions</code> etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, i decided to tweak the default behaviour and take control of error handling. If your use case is similar, then proceed with further steps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"customerrorhandler\">Custom error handler</h3>\n<p>Create your own custom ErrorHandler class (<code>error_handler.ts</code>), this will extend the node's <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_class_error\">Error</a> class.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"typescript language-typescript\">//error_handler.ts\nexport class AppError extends Error {\n    statusCode: number;\n    message: string;\n\n    constructor(statusCode, message) {\n        super(message);\n        this.statusCode = statusCode;\n        this.message = message;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now in your application you can invoke this custom error handler by calling,</p>\n<pre><code class=\"typescript language-typescript\">new AppError(404, 'Unable to find the resource');\n//or\nnew AppError(403, 'You are not authorized to perform this action');\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"wiringerrorinterceptorintoexpressapplication\">Wiring error interceptor into express application</h3>\n<p>Once you start throwing exceptions within your application, next step is to convert those errors into a meaningful response for the end-user. Express app provides a way to hook up a custom error\nhandler into your application. A middleware that takes in 4 parameters is your way to add your custom error handler.</p>\n<p>Let's add the custom error handler function in the same <code>error_handler.ts</code> class and export. This generic function will parse the thrown error and constructs appropriate response.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"typescript language-typescript\">//error_handler.ts\nexport const customErrorHandler = (err, res) =&gt; {\n    const { statusCode, message } = err;\n    res.status(statusCode).json({error: {message}});\n};\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"typescript language-typescript\">import express from 'express';\nimport customErrorHandler from 'error_handler';\nconst app = express();\n\n// Other middlewares, routes... \n\n// Adding your custom error handler.\napp.use((err, req, res, next) =&gt; {\n  customErrorHandler(err, res);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, whenever any error that is thrown in the application will be caught by this error handler. This will in turn respond back with appropriate status code.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dealingwithunknownerrors\">Dealing with unknown errors</h3>\n<p>As you can see, the <code>customErrorHandler</code> has a limitation of handling only the errors that are of type <code>AppError</code> since it expects <code>statusCode</code> to be present in the error.\nHowever, there will be <code>RuntimeExceptions</code> that will occur in the application. It's kind of hard to catch all these sort of errors in the application and re-throw them as custom errors.</p>\n<p>So, we will improve our <code>customErrorHandler</code> to handle such <code>RuntimeExceptions</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"typescript language-typescript\">//error_handler.ts\nconst handleKnownExceptions = (err, res) =&gt; {\n    //log it\n    const { statusCode, message } = err;\n    res.status(statusCode).json({error: {message});\n};\n\nconst handleUnknownExceptions = (err, res) =&gt; {\n    //log it\n    res.status(500).json({ error: {message: 'Something went wrong.' }});\n};\n\nexport const customErrorHandler = (err, res) =&gt; {\n    err instanceof AppError ? handleKnownExceptions(err, res) : handleUnknownExceptions(err, res);\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, we introduced one more way of handling errors. If the caught error is not that of ours (<code>AppError</code>) then we respond back with a 500 response.\nWe don't want our end user to know about the system internals and hence respond with a static message.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dealingwithasynchronousroutes\">Dealing with asynchronous routes</h3>\n<p>This centralized error handling will not work for the errors that are thrown in the <code>await</code> methods i.e, any error that are thrown in an async block will not reach our <code>customErrorHandler</code>.\nThis is a limitation with respect to express 4.x.</p>\n<p>As a workaround, you have to make the routes to be synchronous. Instead of changing all the routes to synchronous blocks i used this\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Abazhenov/express-async-handler\">middleware</a> to achieve a similar effect. Post wrapping my routes with this middleware, all the errors in async block will then reach our  <code>customErrorHandler</code></p>\n<p>Here is the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/prasann/b6ad07b3962b6ea2953fef027df5d10b\">gist</a> to the final <code>error_handler.ts</code></p>",

But i was wrong. Only after the resource transformation http interceptors are called. (Refer this <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/7594\">issue.</a>)</p>\n<p>So, whenever a service responds with 500 error, Http interceptor will redirect the user to a different page. However, this will not happen if there is an error in transformation logic. In order to circumvent this problem, we started writing our error transform response specifically for the error codes. This means that, our transformation logic will not be executed for our generic error codes and eventually it reaches http interceptor.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">{{ site.data.comments }}\n</code></pre>",

While looking for possible approaches to this solution i stepped onto Hystrix.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix\">Hystrix</a> is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure. Using this implementing CircuitBreakers are quite straight forward.</p>\n<p>To start with i wanted to measure the latency of the 3rd party calls that goes through my application. Mine was Java Spring applcation running in Tomcat. As per Hystrix documentation all the third party calls that need to be monitored are to be wrapped within a command. This command will be executed in a separate thread. Since all the 3rd party calls go through this layer it is easy to monitor those calls. It is also possible to define a fallback approach when a particular service call fails. And there by isolating these scenarios from the application code. More of how this works is explained in detail on <a href=\"https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki\">Hystrix wiki</a></p>\n<p>The problem i had was i already have my application up and running. And all i need to do is just monitoring the 3rd party calls (as of now) Now integrating Hystrix meant i need to re design the 3rd party calls to introduce a middle layer to wrap them up.</p>\n<p>I was thinking of writing Aspect based solution to wrap these calls throughout my application with an annotation.</p>\n<p>To do this, make sure you have included Spring AOP in your application. Declare and define an annotation as shown below.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"java language-java\">@Aspect\n@Component\npublic class CircuitBreakerAspect {\n    @Around(\"@annotation(com.example.Monitor)\")\n    public Object monitoringAround(final ProceedingJoinPoint aJoinPoint) throws Throwable {\n        String theShortName = aJoinPoint.getSignature().toShortString();\n        HystrixCommand.Setter theSetter =\n                HystrixCommand.Setter.withGroupKey(HystrixCommandGroupKey.Factory.asKey(theShortName));\n        theSetter = theSetter.andCommandKey(HystrixCommandKey.Factory.asKey(theShortName));\n        HystrixCommand theCommand = new HystrixCommand(theSetter) {\n            @Override\n            protected Object run() throws Exception {\n                try {\n                    return aJoinPoint.proceed();\n                } catch (Exception e) {\n                    throw e;\n                } catch (Throwable e) {\n                    throw new Exception(e);\n                }\n            }\n        };\n        return theCommand.execute();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using Hystrix dashboard you can able to wire the views and could able to monitor the application. More about this is written <a href=\"http://www.mirkosertic.de/doku.php/architecturedesign/springhystrix\">here</a></p>\n<p>However this annotation approach can be used only for monitoring purposes or when you need to do similar actions for all the services. When i moved onto writing circuit breakers this cannor be done since all the service calls need its own fallback approaches. So in that case it was better to implement them as separate commands so all the code will fit within.</p>",

CORS - Cross Origin Resource sharing</h4>\n<p>A detailed description of how to implement is on this <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS\">Mozilla docs</a></p>\n<p>This is a very common and an elegant solution that you can find on the net for this problem. All you will need is to add few headers on the application server. This will allow application to allow requests from other application (domain). And also all the response from the parent application will include a header</p>\n<p>Access-Control-Allow-Origin:</p>\n<p>Which will tell the browser to allow those specified domains to talk to the application.</p>\n<p>This solution works well with most of the modern browsers. Check out for the CORS browser support <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/cors\">here.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Limitations with IE:</strong></p>\n<p>As you can see the browser compatibility chart, IE8 and IE9 has a partial implementation to CORS.</p>\n<p>Modern browsers will be able to support CORS for XMLHttpRequest. However IE8 and IE9 supports CORS using XDomainRequest object. What this means is that they have few limitations of their own.</p>\n<p>Some of the most important constraints are,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your requests should be only GET, POST HTTP methods and not PUT, DELETE etc.</li>\n<li>Both the domain (the calling and the caller) uses the same protocol. Either HTTP or HTTPS.</li>\n<li>Your request should not have any custom headers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The exhaustive list is been detailed out in this <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2010/05/13/xdomainrequest-restrictions-limitations-and-workarounds.aspx\">MSDN blog</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Workaround for IE</strong></p>\n<p>If you think you can live with the constraints mentioned above, then the workaround is quite simple. You got to change all the XHR to XDR to make it work. Luckily if you are using jQuery you don't need to go through changing all the requests. Instead you can use this <a href=\"https://github.com/MoonScript/jQuery-ajaxTransport-XDomainRequest\">jQuery plugin</a> . I guess there are more of these available just check out before breaking your brains.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2jsonpsolution\">2. JSONP Solution</h4>\n<p>Using <a href=\"http://json-p.org/\">JSONP</a> response instead of JSON response.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantage:</strong> No need of any specific workaround for IE8.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Works only for HTTP(S) GET request. If you are planning to use POST/PUT/DELETE this solution is not for you.</p>\n<h4 id=\"3iframehack\">3. iFrame Hack.</h4>\n<p>This is a creepy hack. Lets say, if you want to make a call from appA to appB. In appA's landing page load a hidden iFrame with some URL of appB. Then perform all the requests to appB from that iFrame. Since iFrame's domain is appB browsers' will not complain.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Here the challenge is to consume the response. Your landing page should wait for an even in the iFrame and should consume the iFrame content. Don't even think of this solution if you want to make more than 1 cross site request in a page.</p>\n<h4 id=\"4reverseproxysolution\">4. Reverse Proxy solution</h4>\n<p>If you want your appA to make a call to appB. Set up a simple reverse proxy to the appA. And use relative paths for the Ajax requests, while the server would be acting as a proxy to any remote location.</p>\n<p>So in appA the relative path of the request will be <em>/cors-ajax</em>. The browser will not complain since this is not pointing to a different domain. And the reverse proxy rule will redirect anything of <em>cors-ajax</em> to appB.</p>\n<p>More reference to this implementation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.askapache.com/htaccess/reverse-proxy-apache.html#Configuring_Proxy\">Configuring the Proxy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7807600/apache-mod-proxy-configuring-proxypass-proxypassreverse-for-cross-domain-ajax\">Configuring Mod Proxy - SO</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Limitation:</strong> The server config are quite hard (at least for me) to understand and perform.</p>\n<h4 id=\"5appbasedsolution\">5. App based solution</h4>\n<p>This solution is very similar to that of the reverse proxy but you don't need to make any server config changes. The initial CORS approach sounds reasonable, but few limitations like same protocol might stop us from using it. Applications like <a href=\"http://anyorigin.com/\">AnyOrigin</a>, <a href=\"http://whateverorigin.org/\">WhateverOrigin</a> does that for you. They support http and https so you can use the protocol of the main window and consume the response. If you feel unsafe of using a different domain, you can deploy it in your own infrastructure.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitation:</strong> One more app to maintain :(</p>\n<h4 id=\"6addagenericcontrollerservletinyourparentdomain\">6. Add a generic controller/servlet in your parent domain.</h4>\n<p>Have a controller/servlet in your app which actually does the external domain call. Have only one GET, POST method. Keep posting all your requests to the same end-point with an additional header containing the actual end-point. Inside the method extract the header, make a call and go around about it. This means that browser doesn't know its an external domain call as your app will serve as a wrapper to that external domain call.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Multiple HTTP calls for single request/response.</p>\n<p><strong>More on:</strong> [How to circumvent same origin policy?](\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3076414/ways-to-circumvent-the-same-origin-policy)</p>",

However the problem was we were having too many failures on our initial run, and lot of these failures were classified as random or not reproducable. Mainly these are test script issues. Some times the testers tend to put some static wait conditions which might work on their machine but not in the Jenkins agent. Sometimes the environment against which our tests run might be a bit slow which pushes our pass percentage well behind. The ideal appropriate fix will be is to go through the failed test cases and figure out the randomness and fix it. But we thought of adding a re run mechanism to our test job to identify these random failures. As the no. of test cases grew, we ended up in re running the failed tests multiple times, something like this.</p>\n<p>Name Total Failed</p>\n<p>InitialRun  100 30</p>\n<p>ReRun1 30 20</p>\n<p>ReRun2 20 10</p>\n<p>In this case we will interpret the last 10 failures as a legitimate failures and rest as intermittent ones.</p>\n<p>Please note that this is not a correct approach to reduce the failure count.

Spent some time in investigating the changes to passbook application in iOS7 (beta 4). Here is a quick summary of it.</p>\n<p>Apple listened to its user's feedback and have come with some features which increases the usability of the application.</p>\n<p><strong>Add multiple passes to Passbook.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, you can able to add multiple passes to the Passbook application in one go. So, if you are issuing multiple passes to your users, probably have a page with all the passes and you can have download all link, which downloads all the passes in one shot.</p>\n<p><strong>Delivery through Barcode.</strong></p>\n<p>Apple have added one more delivery mechanism to the passbook. Currently you can deliver a pass through Safari browser (with vnd.apple.pkpass as header)&nbsp;or Through email attachment or to stream from your native iOS application. Now in the new passbook app they have added a barcode scanner. So the content of the pass can be crisped into a barcode and can be delivered to the Passbook application.</p>\n<p><strong>Anchor tags at the back of the pass.</strong></p>\n<p>Currently you can have links, but you cannot have link text. For example if you want to link <a href=\"http://google.com\">http://www.google.com</a> to 'Click here' it is not possible. But it will be possible from iOS7</p>\n<p><strong>Expiration date for Passes.</strong></p>\n<p>Now passes can have its own expiration date. It's a meta data that you can set and after that the passes will be destroyed from the Apple passbook automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>Usage restriction by Geo location.</strong></p>\n<p>You can restrict the usage of passes, within a specific geo location. For example if you are issuing a coupon, then you can make sure that your users could able to access the coupons within a specific geo co-ordinates.</p>\n<p>All these are nice features that are provided in iOS7. So far i was happy with all these news, until i read that, (<a href=\"https://devforums.apple.com/thread/190987?tstart=0\">Dev forum link</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>The rendering algorithms are significantly different from the previous versions.</strong></p>\n<p>This seems to be a major issue to me, since i have to now test the appearance of my pass with new version. And have to think about optimising the design across all the versions.</p>",

On my first glance it looked extremely simple to get going.&nbsp;The app i was working was on node.js, so i had no trouble in including socket.io into my project.</p>\n<p>My app had client and server component. For the server component i could able to do the npm install and got the socket.io working. Whereas for the client component i couldn't able to find the stand alone js available for download. Basically the js comes in along with the npm which means you got to take it out separately if you want to use it. Then i used the js file from their <a href=\"https://github.com/learnboost/socket.io\">Github repo</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bydefaultsocketiodoesntperformbroadcast\">By default Socket.io doesn't perform broadcast</h2>\n<p>This is my first learning. Though it seems to be obvious after taking a good look onto the API, it wasn't very clear for me in the beginning.</p>\n<p><em>For example:</em></p>\n<p><strong>Server</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"js language-js\">var app = require('express')(),\n    server = require('http').createServer(app),\n    io = require('socket.io').listen(server);\n\nserver.listen(80);\n\nio.sockets.on('connection', function(socket) {\n    socket.on('first\\_msg', function(data) {\n        socket.emit('reply', {\n            hello: 'world'\n        });\n    });\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Client 1:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"js language-js\">&lt;script src = \"/socket.io/socket.io.js\" &gt; &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n    var socket = io.connect('http:/ / localhost ');\n    socket.emit('first\\_msg ', { my: 'data1 ' });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Client 2:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"js language-js\">&lt;script src = \"/socket.io/socket.io.js\" &gt; &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n    var socket = io.connect('http:/ / localhost ');\n    socket.on('reply ', function (data){\n        console.log(\"Client1 had pinged server.\");\n    }\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case i was expecting my <em>Client2</em> console.log to execute but that never happened. Reason being whenever <em>Client1</em> emits '<em>first_msg</em>' it was <em>Client1</em> who was receiving the reply too (obvious i know !!).</p>\n<p>So in these cases socket.io provides an API to broadcast messages.Hence instead of</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js language-js\">socket.emit('reply', { hello: 'world' });\n</code></pre>\n<p>it should have been</p>\n<p>socket.broadcast.emit('reply', { hello: 'world' });</p>\n<h2 id=\"exposedeventsinsocketioarejustdefinedforsocketonmethods\">Exposed events in socketIO are just defined for socket.on methods</h2>\n<p>I was trying to emit a custom message from my client. I need to perform some actions on its success and failure. Now i need to attach success and error callbacks. For this i found this <a href=\"https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/wiki/Exposed-events\" title=\"Exposed Events\">Exposed events</a> doc. The funda is that all these exposed events are defined only for socket.on which means while emitting a message i cannot bind any callbacks to it.</p>\n<p>For error callback it is straight forward. We have</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js language-js\">socket.on('error', () -&gt; console.log(\"Error Occured\"))\n</code></pre>\n<p>which can be bound on the socket so whenever an error is been thrown on the socket the defined behaviour gets executed.</p>\n<p><strong>Client</strong> emits the custom message and sends JSON data to the socket via socket.emit, also he gets an update function that handles the success callback</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js language-js\">socket.emit ('message', {hello: 'world'});\nsocket.on ('messageSuccess', function (data) {\n//do something\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Server</strong>-side Gets a call from the message emit from the client and emits the messageSuccess back to the client</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js language-js\">socket.on ('message', function (data) {\n    io.sockets.emit ('messageSuccess', data);\n});\n</code></pre>",

But the problem here is that even with this approach your jQuery POST method is going to receive a HTTP_OK message from the controller. Hence if you are waiting at the error callback then you have no chance of catching this error.</p>\n<p>So what i have done here is to return inline-error view back as the response. On the success callback of the jQuery i check for the presence of the error_div in the response and display the field in the page.

So place the WAR anywhere in the system apart from ${TOMCAT_HOME}/webapps folder.</p></li>\n<li><p>Now its time to start the server and you will see a folder named myapp in the ${TOMCAT_HOME}/webapps folder, containing the application files.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Approach 2: Server.xml ( <a href=\"http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/context.html\">Not Recommended</a> after Tomcat 4.x )</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open the Server.xml file from ${TOMCAT_HOME}/conf folder.

So need to be careful in assigning and using the values from characters() method.</p>\n<p>So the better way to use characters() method is to keep appending all the values to a buffer and use the value in the corresponding end tag section. Also need to make sure that the buffer has to be flushed in the corresponding start element.</p>\n<p><strong>Sample Xml:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"xml language-xml\">&lt;Sample&gt;\n    &lt;StudentCollection&gt;\n        &lt;Student&gt;\n            &lt;Name&gt;Jack&lt;/Name&gt;\n            &lt;Age&gt;12&lt;/Age&gt;\n        &lt;/Student&gt;\n        &lt;Student&gt;\n            &lt;Name&gt;Jill&lt;/Name&gt;\n            &lt;Age&gt;13&lt;/Age&gt;\n        &lt;/Student&gt;\n        &lt;Student&gt;\n            &lt;Name&gt;Rose&lt;/Name&gt;\n            &lt;Age&gt;14&lt;/Age&gt;\n        &lt;/Student&gt;\n    &lt;/StudentCollection&gt;\n&lt;/Sample&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Sample SAX handler code to print the Names:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Initial Code: (Works fine for small values & small files)</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"java language-java\">public void startElement(String uri, String tag, String qName, Attributes attributes) {\n}\n\npublic void characters(char ch[], int start, int length) {\n  System.out.println(\"Name of a student: \" + new String(ch, start, length));\n}\n\npublic void endElements(String uri, String tag, String qName) {\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Final Code:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"java language-java\">public void startElement(String uri, String tag, String qName, Attributes attributes) {\n  if (\"Name\".equals(tag)) {\n    tagContentBuffer = new StringBuffer();\n  }\n}\n\npublic void characters(char ch[], int start, int length) {\n  tagContentBuffer.append(new String(ch, start, length));\n}\n\npublic void endElements(String uri, String tag, String qName) {\n  if (\"Name\".equals(tag)) {\n    System.out.println(\"Name of a student: \" +\n       tagContentBuffer.toString());\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>",

The idea here is that you find an assertion failing, still you may need to go ahead and check out all the assertions as these tests generally take long time to complete. At the end of the test it will be good to have the summary of all the failures along with the stack trace. I was looking for some testing framework to help out with this functionality but unfortunately cant find any.</p>\n<p>Finally using TestNg I implemented this feature. All you need is to write a listener that listens whenever a test fails and simply logs the stack trace without failing the test. There is a neat step by step tutorial given <a href=\"http://seleniumexamples.com/blog/guide/using-soft-assertions-in-testng\">here&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Though this example has some specific information for Selenium based tests, it works fine with normal functional tests too.</p>\n<p>Happy Testing :)</p>",

And i have seen most of the developers prefer to use monochrome fonts as it yields better feel while looking at the code. It is been now widely accepted by many developers to use Inconsolata as their development font. So better start using it and prove yourself geeky ;)<br />\nWhen i tried to use Inconsolata with my IntellijIDEA i couldn't find the ttf type inconsolata. And Intellij supports only ttf types. After a long search i downloaded thr ODf type and converted it to ttf using a converter and then i had the issue of installing it to my Jaunty. And i took help of my dev friends out here to resolve stuffs. So thought of consolidating the steps together as it may reduce someone else's pain.</p>\n<p><strong>Steps to install Inconsolata.ttf in Ubuntu(Jaunty).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start with downloading inconsolata font. <a href=\"http://www.4shared.com/file/xnMYNL0w/Inconsolata.html\">Inconsolata.ttf</a></p>\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>\n<p>mkdir /usr/share/fonts/truetype</p>\n<p>cd /usr/share/fonts/truetype</p>\n<p>sudo mkdir  ttf-inconsolata</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy the Inconsolata.ttf into the directory.</p>\n<p>sudo cp ~/Desktop/Inconsolata.ttf ttf-inconsolata</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now modify the permissions to allow it to be accessed by IDE's</p>\n<p>cd ttf-inconsolata</p>\n<p>sudo chmod 777 Inconsolata.ttf</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Its not over yet. Finally before going to the IDE you need to cache the font to make it accessible.</p>\n<p>sudo fc-cache -f -v</p>\n<p>This will show a list of fonts cached recently. Check whether Inconsolata.ttf is been cached.</p>\n<p>Now you can keep staring at your code for a long time as it feels a lot better :)</p>",
