I had an AWS image which was created using an EC2 instance of size 8 GB. Whenever i try to launch an instance i usually change the storage size to something say 20 GB. But once the system is launched when i do a

```bash
df -h
```

i still see 8 GB and not 20 GB.

On further reading i understood i need to resize the disk size. So i did the same using

```bash
sudo resize2fs /dev/xvde1
```

But i was getting the following error:

The filesystem is already \*\*\* blocks long. Nothing to do!

Then to reolve this issue i have to perform the following steps.

- SSH to the machine.

```bash
fdisk /dev/xvde
```

- You should be seeing this message.

WARNING: DOS-compatible mode is deprecated. It's strongly recommended to switch off the mode (command 'c') and change display units to sectors (command 'u')

- Enter 'u' to change display units
- Enter 'p' to view the current paritions.
- Enter 'd' to delete current partitions.
- Enter 'n' to create a new partition.
- Enter 'p' to set it as primary partitions.
- Enter '1' to set it as primary partitions.
- Set the desired space. If nothing is given the entire space is allotted.
- Enter 'a' to make it bootable.
- Enter '1' and 'w' to write and save the changes.
- Reboot the instance from AWS console.
- Now if you resize the parition it worked all fine.

```bash
sudo resize2fs /dev/xvde1
```

Check the partition size, it should be all set with more space.
